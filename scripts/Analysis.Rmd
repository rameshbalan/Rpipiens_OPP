## LFC Table

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r foldchange, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lfc_file <- read.csv("/home/hdd/4/rna_rpipiens/condition_treated_results.csv")
datatable(lfc_file[complete.cases(lfc_file),], filter="top")
```

## Annotated Table

```{r annotation, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
DE_annotated <- read.csv("/home/hdd/4/rna_rpipiens/BLAST/R_pipiens_DE_transcripts_Annotated.txt", header = FALSE, sep = "\t")
colnames(DE_annotated) <- c("Rana Pipiens Transcript", "Ortholog in X. laevis/tropicalis", "Description")
datatable(DE_annotated, filter="top")
```
